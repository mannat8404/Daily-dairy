Bugs exploration in websites:
Exploring bugs in websites involves several steps and methodologies, usually falling under the umbrella of web application security testing. Here are some key areas and techniques to consider:
1. Information Gathering
• Reconnaissance: Collect as much information as possible about the target website, such as domain names, IP addresses, subdomains, and technologies used (e.g., server types, CMS, frameworks).
• Tools: Nmap, Shodan, Google Dorks, Whois, and built-in browser tools.
2. Vulnerability Scanning
• Automated Scanning: Use tools to scan for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and others.
• Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus, Nikto, and Acunetix.
3. Manual Testing
• Parameter Tampering: Check if input parameters can be manipulated to achieve unintended actions (like your price tampering test).
• Fuzzing: Send a variety of unexpected inputs to the application to find crashes, errors, or other anomalies.
• Logic Flaws: Manually test for business logic vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
• Tools: Browser Developer Tools, Burp Suite, Postman, and manual inspection.
4. Authentication and Authorization Testing
• Session Management: Test for weaknesses in session handling mechanisms.
• Privilege Escalation: Try to access resources or perform actions beyond your current privilege level.
• Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom scripts.
5. Client-Side Testing
• JavaScript Security: Inspect client-side code for vulnerabilities such as DOM-based XSS.
• HTML Injection: Test for injection points in the HTML code.
• Tools: Browser Developer Tools, OWASP ZAP.
6. Database Security Testing
• SQL Injection: Check if inputs can manipulate database queries.
• NoSQL Injection: For NoSQL databases, test for similar injection attacks.
• Tools: sqlmap, NoSQLMap, and manual testing.
7. API Testing
• Endpoint Security: Test the security of APIs used by the application.
• Input Validation: Ensure proper input validation and error handling.
• Tools: Postman, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.
8. Reporting and Mitigation
• Detailed Reporting: Document all found vulnerabilities, their impacts, and steps to reproduce.
• Mitigation Suggestions: Provide recommendations for fixing the vulnerabilities.
• Tools: Custom templates, security testing tools' built-in reporting features.
# Best Practices
• Stay Updated: Regularly update your tools and knowledge about the latest vulnerabilities and security practices.
• Ethical Conduct: Always have proper authorization before performing any tests on a website.
• Continuous Learning: Follow security forums, blogs, and attend conferences or training sessions.
