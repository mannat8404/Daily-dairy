## Introduction to Cyber Security

### Introduction to Cyber Security
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. 

Cybersecurity is very important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems. For data protection, many companies develop software. This software protects the data. Cybersecurity is important because not only does it help to secure information but also our system from virus attacks. The primary goal of cybersecurity is to ensure the privacy of information, the correctness of data, and access to authorized users. This brings us to focus on the 3 crucial aspects of security which are confidentiality, integrity, and privacy of data.

## Introduction to Kali Linux Operating System
Kali Linux (formerly known as Backtrack Linux) is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It does this by providing common tools, configurations, and automations which allow the user to focus on the task that needs to be completed, not the surrounding activity.

Kali Linux contains industry-specific modifications as well as several hundred tools targeted towards various Information Security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Management, and Red Team Testing. Kali Linux is a multi-platform solution, accessible and freely available to information security professionals and hobbyists.
